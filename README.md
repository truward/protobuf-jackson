protobuf-jackson
================

# Overview

This library provides support for JSON serialization for protobuf objects.

Unfortunately standard library provided by google requires both ``gson`` and ``guava`` libraries and this may be an overkill for certain projects that already depend on jackson.

So, if your project already has a dependency on new jackson library and you need JSON support for protobuf, this library is for you!
